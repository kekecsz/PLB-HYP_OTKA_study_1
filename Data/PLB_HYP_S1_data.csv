I felt that my breathing slowed down, but I inhaled more deeply. When something felt itchy or when I fidgeted, I came out of relaxation a bit, but it was easy to get back. My head became pleasantly empty, I had no thoughts most of the time. When I heard the sound of the breathing in the recording, it was a bit disturbing.","I felt like I was completely relaxed. I didn't even bother with controlling my muscles, and it was harder to move them when returning [deinduction]. My mind didn't go empty during the therapist's speech, but afterwards it did. Again, I would compare the experience to sleep. My head slumped. I can't really highlight any emotions, except that I found the therapist a bit annoying.","I felt at ease, relaxed. Among my muscles, I only felt my neck muscles. I felt calm. I breathed deeply, slowly. At times I got in tune with the faint, soft sounds audible in the recording.

""","Először a zúgás járt a fülemben ami először nagyon idegesítőnek tűnt, aztán arra próbáltam koncentrálni, hogy azt képzelem ez csak a szél hangja. Így már kellemesebb volt a hang. Szerintem az előző változathoz képest ez kevésbé volt számomra hatásos módszer. Jobban szeretem ha a relaxált állapotot vagy csendben vagy beszéd mellett tudom elérni. ","Az eddigi módszerek közül egyértelműen ez volt az amelyben a legkevésbé  mélyültem el. A sapka kicsit kényelmetlen és a nyakam kezd fájni, és nehezebben tudtam koncentrálni.  Az eddigiekhez képest kevesebb kép/gondolat jött elő a relaxáció alatt. ","Most nem éreztem, hogy a hipnózis bármilyen hatással lenne rám, magamat láttam kívülről ahogy ülök a szobában. Általában szeretem amikor a relaxáció során végigveszik hogy milyen testrészt lazítsunk el, ez a rész kifejezetten tetszett viszont amikor csendben ültem valamiért nem tudtam elvonatkoztatni a helyzettől, a sapkától a fejemen stb.","I tried to relax and turn my attention inwards to my thoughts and feelings.

I think it was a less effective method for me compared to the previous one. I prefer to achieve the relaxed state either in silence or while listening to human speech.","Of all the methods so far, this was clearly the one in which I was the least immersed. The hat was a bit uncomfortable and my neck was starting to hurt and I found it harder to concentrate. Fewer images/thoughts came up during relaxation than before.","Now I didn't feel that [text deleted for blinding] had any effect on me, I saw myself from outside sitting in the room.

Összeséggében azért kitudtam kapcsolódni.","Teljesen ébernek éreztem magam aközben is. Mivel előzőleg beszélt a terapeuta egy olyan témáról ami nem igazám érdekelt, így elkezdtem gondolatban másról elmélkedni és kevésbé figyeltem a terapeutára, emiatt nem tudtam kikapcsolni és végig miközben csendben kellett ülni azon elmélkedtem mikor lesz vége ennek a szaksznak.","Az elején egy ideig olyan érzésem volt mintha aludtam volna, majd jött félidőnél a felébredés élménye.

But overall I was able to turn off.","I felt fully awake during this.

Because of this, I couldn't switch off and I kept thinking about when this session would end while I sat quietly.","At the beginning I felt like I was asleep for a while, and then at half time I had the waking up experience.

Kis idő elteltével azonban érzékeltem, hogy a testem sokkal nyugodtabb, ellazultabb, mint bármikor máskor, kifejezetten súlytalannak éreztem magam. Először a lábam, aztán a karjam, végül az arcizmaim is könnyednek, lazának tűntek. Azonban a gondolataim nem szűntek meg áramlani, az figyelmem nem összpontosult csak erre a laza állapotra. Összefoglalva tehát úgy éreztem, a testemre, izmaimra hatott ez az állapot, de az elmémre, mentális folyamataimra kevésbé, bár hozzáteszem, kifejezetten érdekes volt, hogy tényleg abban a pillanatban nyitottam ki a szemem, mikor a \hang\"" kimondta ezt az utasítást.""","Kifejezetten kellemetlen élményt tapasztaltam a fejemben. Mintha blokkolva lett volna valami, nem tudna felszínre törni. Azt éreztem, a \tudatom\""(?) valamibe beleütközik mikor cselekedni akar. Nagyon kényelmetlen és frusztráló érzés volt számomra ezért addig próbálkoztam amíg sikerült végre kizökkennem belőle - kinyitottam a szemem egy pillanatra. Körülbelül 1-2 perc lehetett mire ez valóban sikerült. Nem volt jó ezt érezni hogy nem tudok irányítani...""","Nem éreztem elmélyült, módosult állapotot. De az előtte levő, izmokról szóló szövegre koncentráltan tudtam figyelni, és ez a koncentráltság, úgy éreztem, megmaradt. Kicsit ezt felhasználva a testemre irányítottam a figyelmem. Végig tudatosnak éreztem azt, amit csinálok - gondolok -, úgyhogy ez csak egy kellemes összpontosítás volt számomra.","Ha nem tudnám, hogy ez nem hipnózis volt, azt hinném, hogy hipnózis volt. Teljesen ellazultam, elernyedt a testem. A gondolataimat sikerült gyorsan elhesegetnem, nyugalomban voltam. Mély, pihentető állapot volt ez, talán az alváshoz hasonló.","It didn't seem effective at first, I thought it felt the same as a meditation practice. After a while, however, I felt that my body was much more calm and relaxed than at any other time, and I felt weightless. First my legs, then my arms and finally my facial muscles felt light and relaxed. However, my thoughts did not stop flowing, my attention was not focused only on this relaxed state. So, to sum up, I felt that my body and muscles were affected by this state, but my mind and mental processes were less affected, although I must add that it was very interesting that I actually opened my eyes right when the 'voice' said [text deleted for blinding].""","I had a distinctly unpleasant experience in my head. As if something was blocked, unable to surface. I felt that my ""consciousness""(?) was bumping into something when it wanted to act. It was a very uncomfortable and frustrating feeling for me, so I kept trying until I finally managed to break out of it - I opened my eyes for a moment. It took about 1-2 minutes until I actually did it. It was not good to feel like I had no control...""","I did not feel a deepened, altered state. But I was able to concentrate on the [text deleted for blinding] text in front of it, and that concentration, I felt, remained. I used a little of that to focus my attention on my body. I felt conscious all the time of what I was doing - I think - so it felt more of a pleasant concentration for me.","If I didn't know it was [text deleted for blinding], I would think it was [text deleted for blinding]. I was completely relaxed, my body relaxed. I managed to get my thoughts out quickly, I was at peace.

""","lehet, hogy elkerülte a figyelmem, de én nem hallottam, hogy mondta volna, hogy csukjam be a szemem... szóval nem igazá éreztem semmit. unalmas volt a szöveg. elnézelődtem és megint azt vártam, hogy érjünk a hatásosabb részhez végre. ","na végre! ez volt eddig a leghatásosabb. a  beszéd résznél is egész jól működött a dolog, aztán amikor csend lett, megint jött egy gondolat, hogy jaj, minek, de végül pont az volt a legjobb rész, mert kezdtem azt érezni, hogy mindjárt elalszom. nem is volt kedvem kinyitni a szemem, ez mehetett volna tovább is. emberünk beszéde egyébként hagy némi kivetni valót maga után.. fura. meg van egy rész, ahol kétszer mondja a szót, azt kivághatták volna, mindig feltűnik. a hangja sem az a tipikus megnyugtató fajta, de ez lehet, hogy csak az én szubjektív véleményem. mindenesetre összességében ez a rész esett a legjobban. ","ez is jó volt. először meglepődtem a fehérzaj hangerején, meg kicsit durvának tűnt, de szép lassan átváltott egy kellemes érzésre. olyan volt, mint egy vízesés. jól el tudtam mélyülni benne a végére, mehetett volna tovább, megint hirtelen jött a csend, de később azt is megszoktam és belekényelmesedtem, tudtam volna aludni megint. az előzőnél elfelejtettem írni, de sokat segített, hogy lejjebb csúsztam a széken. emberünk beszéde még mindig kissé zavaró, de lényegtelen. összességében ez is jóleső élmény volt. ","The position is uncomfortable, it would be more effective lying down. I felt discomfort on the right side of my neck, probably due to the heaviness of the cap. I felt that we could be moving on to the more exciting part and that it was ridiculous to [text deleted for blinding] so fast, especially after a busy day. I felt the silent time was too long, which makes it easy for thoughts to start wondering--at least mine. Unfortunately, the neck pain distracted my deeper focus and that caused the biggest problem.","Maybe I missed it, but i didn't hear them saying to close my eyes... so it didn't really feel anything. the text was boring. I looked away and waited again for the more impressive part to come.","Finally! That was the most effective so far. The [text deleted for blinding] part worked pretty well, then during the silence part I had another thought of ""oh why,"" but in the end that was the best part, because I started to feel like I was falling asleep. I didn't even feel like opening my eyes, it could have gone on for longer. The man's speech leaves something to be desired... strange. and there is a part where he says the word twice, it could have been cut out [from the audio], it always stands out. His voice is not the typical soothing kind either, but that might just be my subjective opinion. Anyway, overall, I liked this part the best.","This one was good too. At first I was surprised by the volume of [text deleted for blinding], and it sounded a bit harsh, but slowly it turned into a nice feeling. It was like a waterfall. I could get deeper into it by the end, it could have gone on, the silence came on again suddenly, but later I got used to it and settled in, I could sleep again. At the previous one I forgot to write down but it helped a lot to slide down a chair. Our man's speech was still a bit disturbing, but irrelevant. Overall, it was a pleasant experience",Yes,"korábban megírtam, de tulajdonképpen az első után már nem észleltem a nyakfájdalmat olyan feltűnően.

A szemeim előtt kb 1 percig színes körkörösen hullámzó vonalakat láttam (mint az állóvíz fodrozódása, amikor beleesik valami), aztán elég hamar visszatértek a gondolataim, és átlagosan éreztem magam, mint amikor csak pihenek.","Fizikailag ellazultam, teljesen el tudtam engedni magam, még egy nagyon gyenge bizsergésszerű érzésem is volt. Szellemileg viszont nem tudtam kikapcsolni, továbbra is jöttek a gondolataim és már azt terveztem, hogy ezt a leírást hogyan fogom megfogalmazni. A felvétel közepétől már vártam, hogy vége legyen, kicsivel a befejezés előtt magamtól elkezdtem átmozgatni a testrészeimet, mert kezdtem kényelmetlenül érezni magam. ","Nyugodt, ellazult voltam, a gondolatmeneteim nem álltak meg. Az elején unatkoztam.","It was similar to [text deleted for blinding] at the beginning of the test, I was calm, but my mind was still racing.","At the beginning I managed to stay in a more deepened state, which developed during [text deleted for blinding]. For about 1 minute I saw colourful circular wavy lines in front of my eyes (like the ripples of standing water when something falls into it), then soon enough my thoughts returned and I felt average, like I was just relaxing.","I was physically relaxed, I could let go completely, I even had a very slight tingling sensation. Mentally, however, I couldn't switch off, my thoughts kept coming and I was already planning how I was going to write this. From the middle of the recording I was waiting for it to be over, a little before the end I started to move my body parts by myself because I was getting uncomfortable.","I was calm, relaxed, my train of thought never stopped.

There were a few moments when I was afraid I'd fall asleep for real, and had to remind myself to stay alert. At other times I would feel agitated and impatient, wishing I could do something more productive instead, maybe go through with one of my usual meditations. Overall it was an uncomfortable experience. ","From the begining I felt both disappointed and agitated, since I had been very eager to try and experience hipnosis for real this time. Throughout the time Ispent with my eyes closed, I felt pretty alert, even restless, so naturally once I heard the recording start again I was very relieved. I'm sure this is an effective technique for relaxation, but since I came here expecting much more exciting events, all I could do throughout is think about how I'm going to describe my experience later. At least I didn't have to fight off sleepm this time.","From the start Iwas very anxcious to get 'properly hipnotised', so I'm hoping that this was finally it. This state I was in felt pretty close to what I'd experience during a meditation, but somehow it was different too. When I was left to just experience whatever I could, I was suprised to find that instead of the usual flow of thoughts my mind felt empty and looked like a white orb, full of light and only my inner monologue to keep me company. First I just marvelled at the experience, then I started telling my mind that from now on I'll be able to sleep better, have more energy to clean and cook and stay healthy in general, and to focus more during my studying sessions. Then at the very end for some reason I had the idea of telling my two hands to get further away from each other and then come back together again, I'm not sure if them obeying was the product of the hipnotic state I may have been in, but it was fun regardless. Coming back to my usual state felt different as well, during the previous two trials I could not wait to open my eyes fast enough, but now I was suprised at how in sinc my actions were with the instructions.","Now this was a bit different from the previous, I'm guessing more hypnotic state, this felt more like meditation. For starters, I felt I had to actively participate in maintaining my focus, my mind wasn't as empty as before, and on a few ocasions I found myself drifting away, completely absorbed in my plans about what to eat later, or which path I'm gonna take once I'm done here and can walk away. Nevertheless I tried, once again giving suggestions to myself about better sleep and whatnot, but I'm afraid it won't be half as potent as I felt i t was last time. Returning was also a bit less controlled by the audio I was listening to, but still far from what it was like during the two control tasks. Anyhow, my mind went a bit gray and foggy on a few ocasions and my ability to stay in the moment definitely decreased, but it was still somewhat relaxing I guess.","I was already feeling sleepy before the excercise started, which only increased while I was sitting with my eyes closed.

Volt néhány perc, amikor úgy éreztem, valóban bekövetkezik az az egyre mélyebbre való zuhanás, amit az elején a számolással kellett volna elérni. De éreztem bizonyos fokú elmélyülést, nem mélyebbet, mint amit meditációban szoktam.","Meglepődtem, hogy be kellett volna csukni a szememet, végig nyitva tartottam. Nem éreztem magamat elmélyültebben, mint az első után, csak mintha lassabban történtek volna az események. Néha megmozdítottam a karomat, lábamat, de azok a mozdulatok is lassabban mentek, mint az első rész alatt. ","Kissé ideges voltam, vártam, hogy újra megszólaljon a hang. Nem éreztem magamat elmélyültebbnek, mint egy átlagos nap végén, elalváskor. Ez volt eddig a legkevésbé pihentető a három rész közül. Sok, átlagos gondolatom támadt közben.","Most talán még idegesebb voltam, mint az előző alkalommal. Valamiért nem találtam meg a kényelmes pózt, nem tudtam elmélyülni úgy, ahogy azt szerettem volna. 
","Sometimes I was sitting uncomfortably, so I started positioning myself, which made me feel a bit guilty because I was afraid that this would interfere with the experiment. There were a few minutes when I felt that I was really going to fall deeper and deeper that [text deleted for blinding] was supposed to achieve at the beginning. But I felt a certain degree of deepening, no deeper than I usually feel in meditation.","I was surprised that I should have closed my eyes, I kept them open the whole time. I didn't feel any more absorbed than after the first one, it just felt like things happened more slowly. Sometimes I moved my arms and legs, but those movements were slower than during the first part.","I was a little nervous, waiting for the voice to come back. I felt no more absorbed than I would at the end of a normal day, when I fell asleep. This was the least relaxing of the three episodes so far. I had a lot of ordinary thoughts.","This time, I was probably even more nervous than the last time.

Amúgy nem nagyon sikerült elmélyülni, olyan kezdeti meditatív állapotként írnám le, de úgy éreztem még jelen vagyok, tudatában voltam mi történik. Viszont jól esett, kellemes, nyugodt érzés volt, de járt az agyam mindenfelé.","Szintén egy kezdetleges meditatív állapotot éltem át, sikerült teljesen ellazulnom, kizárni a külvilágot, de nehéz leállítani a gondolataimat, ezért nem tudom azt mondani, hogy 100%-ig teljesült, az amit elképzeltem, de kicsit megtudtam feledkezni a mindennapi problémáktól, ami szuper érzés.","Nem tudom az adatok mit mondanak, vagy, hogy mennyire elmélyült hatást kéne átélnem, de én meg vagyok bizonyosodva róla, hogy teljesen itt vagyok és tudatában vagyok mindennek, ez így jó? :D Megint csak az ellazult, békés állapotot éreztem, az izmokról szóló bevezető után jobban fókuszáltam a testemre, hogy mit csinál. És elkezdtem éhes lenni, de amint véget ért a hipnózis, már nem éreztem éhség érzetet. Ez volt csak, ami más volt, mint az előző kettőnél. A testem zsigereinek érzése került középpontba.","Mélyebben, mélyebben, mélyebben...ez a szó ment eleinte a fejembe. Minél mélyebbre szeretnék ásni a tudatomban, és megtudni miért nem tudom kikapcsolni azt. Vagy megtudni mi zajlik pontosan ott és a tudatalattimba, bár azt lehet jobb nem tudni. Úgy érzem a testem eltud lazulni, de ébernek érzem magam a kavargó zajos gondoltok miatt, emiatt sosem tudtam teljesen ellazítani a tudatomat. Ezt promlémának érzem. Ilyeneken gondolkodtam közben, amúgy meg megint kellemes élmény volt, elvagyok a zsibongó tudatommal.","When I heard [text deleted for blinding], I first thought of a [text deleted for blinding], and I found myself at this [text deleted for blinding], and then into the [text deleted for blinding] itself, imagining it as a way to drift through the universe. I didn't really get immersed, I would describe it as a kind of initial meditative state, but I felt I was still present, aware of what was happening. But it felt good, it was a nice, calm feeling, but my mind was going all over the place.","I also experienced a rudimentary meditative state, I managed to relax completely, shut the outside world out, but it was hard to stop my thoughts, so I can't say that I achieved 100% of what I had imagined, but I was able to forget a little about everyday problems, which feels super.","I don't know what the data says, or how much of an immersive effect I should be experiencing, but I'm convinced that I'm fully here and aware of everything, is that right? :D Again, I just felt the relaxed, peaceful state, after [text deleted for blinding] I was more focused on my body, what it was doing. And I started to feel hungry, but as soon as [text deleted for blinding] was over, I didn't feel hungry anymore. It was just this, that was different from the previous two. It was the visceral feeling of my body that came into the centre.","Deeper, deeper, deeper...that's the word that went through my head at first. I wanted to dig deeper into my consciousness and find out why I can't turn it off. Or find out what exactly is going on there and in my subconscious, although it may be better not to know. I feel like my body can relax, but I feel awake because of the swirling noisy thoughts, which is why I've never been able to fully relax my consciousness. I think that this is a problem. I was thinking about these things, but it was a pleasant experience again, I can live with my mind buzzing.",No,,Female,2,5,6,5,5,"Heard/read about it on the internet;Heard/read about it on radio, podcast;Personal experience (seen hypnosis used on someone else, e.g. clinical hypnosis or stage hypnosis);",,hun,10,relaxation,whitenoise,relaxation,embedded,confusion,V10,No,Yes,,5930933,,1419312,6427815,,1001650,,2931617,,4461062,6064540,,610355,,1130032,,1182823,6163,,5909922,,1229880,,1307149,6427764,6064489,5956276,6844161,1001504,667895,7650753,7308050,,1258367,,5930932,667944,,1052342,5956326,6008179,4480296,6178,7308100,,643181,,7295698,,5955147,,1020007,2021-04-27T12:29:34.243925,2021-04-27T12:42:39.675432,2021-04-27T13:07:56.634158,2021-04-27T13:33:06.544197,2021-04-27T13:57:42.575694,2021-04-27T14:20:14.399346,2021-04-27T14:25:57.103595,2021-04-27T12:18:28.238087,2021-04-27T12:18:29.171106,2021-04-27T12:42:39.675432,2021-04-27T13:07:56.634158,2021-04-27T13:33:06.545195,2021-04-27T13:57:42.575694,2021-04-27T12:44:27.893488,2021-04-27T13:09:39.410101,2021-04-27T13:34:49.320820,2021-04-27T13:59:30.788311,2021-04-27T12:50:05.274841,2021-04-27T13:15:10.320880,2021-04-27T13:40:24.955797,2021-04-27T14:05:34.064912,2021-04-27T12:57:01.673206,2021-04-27T13:22:06.716294,2021-04-27T13:47:21.351465,2021-04-27T14:12:30.461155,sham,TRUE,sham,TRUE,No,No,SJLGY11,confusion,relaxation,4/27/2021 15:24:28,"YF, AL",2142711,4/27/2021,11:15:00 AM,2:35:00 PM,1,1,"Participants seated, Common sense eligibility check (those are not allowed to participate who are not at least 18 years old, who have participated in this study before, and who are clearly under the influence of recreational drugs or alcohol, and who had COVID-like symptoms), Participants are relaxed, not rushed, “Experiment in Progress” sign (or equivalent) to avoid disturbance","Turn phones to flight mode and put it away (not in their pockets), Loose any items which they are wearing and are tight and take off their accessories, No chewing gums in their mouths, Use toilet if they need to, Built a rapport about hypnosis, Explain about the EEG procedure, Answer participants' questions if any, Offer participants to use surgical mask if they are not comfortable with theirs","The experiment will take about one hour and half during which they will go through four different procedure, They should read each technique' instruction carefully, Adjust volume on headphone - if it felt uncomfortable during the experiment they can adjust its placement, They can call us at any time during the experiment if they need anything (e.g. need to use toilet), Ask them not to shake their head or turn it to left or right., They can eat during inter-procedures intervals, Put the warning chair in the entryway and turn the red warning light on., Start recording EEG before starting OS program, Tell participant to slow down the mouse click speed (it might cause skipping a page), Disable internet connection of the participants' computer",The EEG channels went noisy (please indicate the channel names in the next section),"ECG electrode fell off during the first procedure, so an experimenter entered the room to adjust it again, after the first procedure (but accidentally a few seconds before the audio ended).","First, in Recorder software, stop both the recording and monitoring., Turn off the amplifier first, then disconnect it from the cap, and then take the cap off the participants' heads., Debriefing: give participant a complete information about the study (which procedures were the real hypnosis and which ones were control), Ask how they feel and make sure they feel completely aware and awake (If they felt dizzy or had a headache, tell them it is a normal feeling and offer them water and snacks, Make sure the tub of gel is firmly closed., Disinfect the recording and control rooms with isopropyl alcohol, Close the curtain in the control room to prevent the EEG cap from being exposed to the sunlight., Check if there is personal information in free-text descriptions.

Pihentető, nyugtató, amikor a 10-től 1 fele számolt és azt mondta 3 körül, hogy most bármit megteszek, amit mondott, azért az felidegesített, mert persze, hogy nem teszek meg bármit. 

Aztán ellazultak az izmaim, ha nem is volt hipnózis, azért megnyugtató volt. 
Az első pár percben még nagyon pörögtek a gondolataim és kb a 3-4-ig perctől nyugodhattam le, de mivel arról nem volt utasítás, hogy a gondolataimat nyugtassam le, ezért egy idő után, ahogy kényelmes volt, elgondolkodtam a hétköznapi problémáimon. Bár jó volt ezekre így nyugodtan gondolni, s egy két megoldásban is megerősödtem. (Pl.: hogy reggel 6-tól délig 6 órán át tudok dolgozni a vállalkozásomban, s elég eredményesen haladhatok akkor. Ezért megérni időben lefeküdni, 11-12 óra körül).
Lehet erre nem voltak kíváncsiak, de azért leírtam, nekem ez lényeges volt közben. 
Aztán a torkom elkezdett kaparni, s elgondoltam, hogy nem kéne kinyissam a szemem, de mivel ez \csak\"" egy kontroll felmérés volts arról is volt szó hogy nyugodtan mozgathatom a kezem vagy a lábam ha úgy kényelmesebbígy úgy döntöttem hogy iszok egy kis vizet mert tovább nem bírom a torok kaparást. (Ez valószínüleg meglátszik majd az EEG felvételen). Az 1-10-ig számlálás alatt én úgy már úgy éreztem hogy rég aktív vagyok de azért olyan érzés is volt hogy jobban felébredek. Ásítottam egyet az 1 után. Illetve tök nagy öröm volt h ránéztem a tőlem balra lévő monitorras láttam az EEG- vonalakat s a szívem is :)""","A testem jobban el volt lazulva, mint az előzőnél. Nyugodtank éreztem magam. 
Közben sok mindenen pörgött az agyam: pl, hogy a fehér zajt, azt hiszem, hogy alvás közben jó, bizonyos fázisokban hatékony. 
Meg az jutott eszembe, hogy ennek olyan hangja van, mint a vízesésnek. S ha ez ilyen jó, akkor vízesés mellé költözve sokat lehetne hallgatni. De el is mehetnék sátorban aludni vízesés mellé. 
Aztán azon is gondolkodtam, hogy lehet, hogy szándékosan éppen fordítva van mondva-írva, hogy melyik a hiponózis, s melyik nem az? Mindenesetre, ez is tetszett. 

Aztán hagytam, hogy a fantáziám szárnyaljon tovább. Mivel kutatóként, adatelemzőként dolgozom most, ezért elképzeltem, hogy majd évek múlva, lehet én is ilyen kutató, egyetemi adjunktus. S mivel a jelenlegi álmom, hogy campervan-ben (lakókocsiban) éljek, ezért elképzeltem, hogy nagy egyetemi adjunktus vagyok, s néha az autómban lakok, s az egyetem területére behajtok autóval. Az emberek azt gondolják rólam, hogy bolond vagyok, hogy autóban élek, miközben egyetem igazgató vagyok, mégis a bolondságom mellett szeretem az embereket, s ez a lényeg.

Aztán a legvégén nagyon laza volt a testem, s kicsit olyan volt, mint ha nem is gondolkoznék, s élveztem az itt levést, az állapotot. Amikor szólt a hipnoterapeuta, hogy ébresztő, akkor igazán fel kellett ébredjek, mert ha nem is alvás közeli állapotban voltam, de azért nyugodtan. 

Te jó ég, az előbb is ásítottam, a monitoron pedig mindent összekarcolt :P","Előtte elképzletem ahogy barátaimnak azt mondtom, hogy mi a fasz volt ez?

De mikor kezdődött érdekes volt. 
Elgondolkodtam azon, hogy ilyen bizalmatlan vagyok egy terapeutával, hogy állandóan megfejteni akarom, hogy mikor van kísérlet, s mikor van becsapás. Hogy ilyen bizalmatlan vagyok? 

Aztán arra is gondoltam, hogy előzőnél le akartam írni, hogy közben azon is gondolkoztam, hogy le fogom írni a tapasztalatom (mert már tudtam, hogy utólag le fogom írni). 

Aztán azon is gondolkoztam, hogy én állandóan felülvizsgálom a saját cselekvésemet? Állandóan kontroll alatt akarom tartani magam? Most meg azon gondolkodom, hogy ekkora elismerésre vágyom, mert elképzelem, hogy különleges vagyok, s aki ezt olvassa felismeri, hogy egy tehetség vagyok, de legalábbis kirívó eset. 

Apun gondolkoztam még, amikor ő azt mondta, hogy nem gondolkozik párbeszédben a fejében, csak képileg gondolkozik. Én pedig nem hittem el. S húgom is ezt mondta, hogy csak úgy gondolkozik párbeszédben, ha képet is lát mellé. Én pedig tudok magammal párbeszédet folytatni. 

De lehet, hogy apu és húgom különleges ritka, akit nem ismertem fel? Lehet hogy ők híres ritkaságok lehetnének? S éppen nem ismertem fel őket? Ezt valahogy nem hittem el, amikor először hallottam őket, sőt, azt mondtam, h nem igaz. ","Elcsodálkoztam, hogy ennyi izmunk van. 
Meg eszembe jutott, hogy a volt osztálytársam (Romániában) tegnap azt mondta, hogy fáj maga. S arra utalt, hogy fájnak az izmai. Olyan szomorú, hogy a testünk ekkora nagy része izom, s ahoz képzest alig használjuk. 
Kellett volna mondjam neki, hogy ha így be van görcsölve az izma, hogy egy jó lehet elazítaná (nem velem, én itt vagyok Mo-n). 
Már megint azon is gondolkoztam, hogy aki ezt olvassa, mit gondolhat rólam, már az állapotban elgondoltam, hogy ezt leírom, nehogy félre értse az olvasó. 

Amúgy meg hol volt itt szubliminális hatás? Ok, értem, hogy a szubliminálist éppen nem fognám fel... na mindegy, de hatását sem éreztem. 
A végén untam, mint ahogy az első alkalom végét is. Próbáltam azért nem mocorogni, hogy ne rontsam el az EEG-t, mert itt a hölgyek kértek, hogy ne nagyon mocorogjak közben. 
De ezért egy két ásítás belement...
Szerintem a levegő is elfogyott ebben a teremben.

El is gondoltam, hogy mindenk kísérleti alany előtt kiszellősztetnek ugyan olyan hosszasan? Márhogy a kísérleti körülmény azonos legyen. (Kérdeztem a hölgyeket, hogy a villanyt szabad-e lekapcsolni, de mondták, hogy muszáj azonos maradjon a körülmény.) Jogos, semmi gond, csak gondolom az oxigén is fontos nekünk. Az utolsó bekezdésem már nem az alkalomról szól.  ","Well, it was good at the beginning. It was relaxing, it was calming, when [text deleted for blinding] it made me nervous, because of course I'm not going to do anything. 
 
 Then my muscles relaxed, even if it wasn't [text deleted for blinding], it was relaxing. 
 For the first few minutes my mind was racing and I could calm down from about minute 3-4, but since there was no instruction to calm down my mind, after a while, as soon as it was comfortable, I thought about my everyday problems. It was good to think about them calmly, though, and I was confirmed in one or two solutions (e.g. that I could work in my business from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m. and be quite productive then. Therefore, it was worth going to bed on time, around 11-12 p.m.).
 Maybe you are not curious about this, but I wrote it down anyway, it was important to me then.
 Then my throat started to scratch, and I thought I shouldn't open my eyes, but since [text deleted for blinding] I can move my hands or feet if it's more comfortable, I decided to drink some water because I can't stand the throat scratching any longer. (This will probably show up in the EEG recording). During the [text deleted for blinding] I felt like I was active for a long time, but I also felt like I was waking up more. I took a yawn after [text deleted for blinding]. It was also a great pleasure to look at the monitor to my left and see the EEG lines and my heart :)""","My body was more relaxed than before. I felt relaxed. 
 In the meantime, I was thinking about many things: for example, [text deleted for blinding], which I think is good during sleep, effective in certain phases. 
 I also remembered that it sounds like a waterfall. And if it's that good, I could listen to it a lot more by moving next to a waterfall. Or I could sleep in a tent next to a waterfall. 
 Then I also wondered if it was deliberately written the other way round, [text deleted for blinding]? Anyway, I liked this one too. 
 
 Then I let my imagination run wild. Since I'm a researcher and data analyst now, I imagined that years from now, I could be a researcher like that, an adjunct professor. And since my current dream is to live in a camper van, I imagined myself as a big university lecturer, sometimes living in my car and driving into the university campus. People think I'm crazy to live in a car when I'm a university director, but I'm crazy and I love people, and that's the point.
 
 Then at the very end my body was very relaxed, and it was a bit like I wasn't even thinking, and I enjoyed being here, enjoying the state of being here. When the [text deleted for blinding] wake up, I really had to wake up, because I was not in a state close to sleep, but I was relaxed. 
 
 Oh my god, I was yawning just now and the monitor was scratching everything :P","Before that I imagined saying to my friends, what the fuck was that?
 
 But when it started, it was interesting. 
 It made me think about how I'm so distrustful of a [text deleted for blinding] that I'm constantly trying to decipher when there's an attempt of deception and when there's disappointment. How am I so distrustful? 
 
 Then I also thought about the fact that I wanted to write down my experience when I was writing it down (because I already knew I was going to write it down afterwards). 
 
 Then I also wondered, am I constantly monitoring my own actions? Do I want to keep myself controlled all the time? And now I wonder if I want to be recognised so much, because I imagine that I am special, and that whoever reads this will recognise that I am talented, or at least a unique. 
 
 I was still thinking about my father when he said that he doesn't think in dialogue in his head, he only thinks visually. And I didn't believe it. And my sister said the same thing, that she only thinks in dialogue when she sees a picture next to it. And I can have a dialogue with myself. 
 
 But maybe my dad and sister are a special rarity I didn't recognize? Could they be famous rarities? And I just didn't recognize them? I somehow didn't believe that when I first heard them, and even said it wasn't true.","I was amazed that we have so many [text deleted for blinding]. 
 And I remembered that my former classmate (in Romania) told me yesterday that he was hurting. He was referring to the fact that his muscles hurt. It's so sad that so much of our body is muscle and we hardly use our muscles. 
 I should have told him that if his muscles are so cramped, that it would be good to relax them (not with me, I'm here in Hungary). 
 Again, I wondered what anyone reading this might think of me, I thought about writing this down in case the reader misunderstood. 
 
 Anyway, where was the [text deleted for blinding] effect here? Okay, I understand that [text deleted for blinding]... anyway, but I didn't feel the effect either. 
 I was bored by the end, as I was by the end of the first time. I tried not to move around so as not to ruin the EEG, because the ladies here asked me not to move around too much. 
 But that took a yawn or two...
 I think the air in this room was running out.
 
 I wondered if the room was ventilated for the same length of time before every new subject? (I asked the ladies if the lights should be turned off, but they said they had to keep the conditions the same.) Right, no problem, I guess oxygen is important for us too.

Furcsa zümmögő, bizsergő érzés volt az egész testemben, de kellemes és nyugodt élmény volt. Néha mintha kicsit elvesztettem volna, hogy most egy helyben ülök vagy dőlök vagy ringatózok. De voltak tisztább gondolataim, például, hogy éhes vagyok, vagy random emlékképek tegnapról. ","Kellemes, nyugodt állapot volt, a kezeim kellemesen elnehezültek. Több tiszta gondolatom is volt. A számolásnál, már kettőnél kinyitottam a szemem, sokkal konnyebb volt visszatérni az éber állaoptba. A fülhallagó húzta a hajam, ami eléggé zavart, de nem mertem  megigazítani. Nem éreztem bizsergést, csak kellemes elnehezesést. Most azt sem éreztem volna, hogy ringatóznék vagy ne tudnám behatárolni, hogy pontosan milyen pozícióban a van a testem. De nyugodt voltam.","Kellemes, olyamsi érzés volt, mint amikor lefekszem aludni és megjelennek ilyen emlékképek a napomról, amiket mintha megint átélnék. Szóval sok ilyen elég vivid emlékképem volt, főleg tegnapról, mint amikor az ember este végig gondolja  a napját, közben félig alszik... Eléggé ellazultam és lassan sikerült kijönni ebből az állapotból, nagyjából  a hatodik számolásra. ","Kellemes, bizsergő, nem tudnám megmondni mennyi ideig tatott. Eléggé hullámzó volt, hogy mennyire éreztem magam ellazultnak, de nem vártam az idő végét, mert kellemes volt ebben az állapotban lenni. Volt egy ilyen furcsa összefüggés egy dologgal kapcsolatban, ami egyszercsak hirtelen megfogalmazódott bennem, olyan ráébredés szerűen. A gondolataim olyanaok voltak, mintha valami meleg ködön keresztül értékelném őket. Néha jött egy-egy, hol tisztábban, hogy kevésbé isztán és voltak olyan időszakakok, amikor csak a meleg köd volt, a gondolatok nem. ","It was like lying half asleep on a rocking boat. There was a strange buzzing, tingling sensation throughout my body, but it was a pleasant and relaxing experience. Sometimes it was as if I was a little lost as to whether I was sitting or reclining or rocking in one place. But I had clearer thoughts, like being hungry, or random flashbacks from yesterday.","It was a pleasant, relaxed state, my hands felt pleasantly heavy. I had several clear thoughts. [text deleted for blinding] I opened my eyes, it was much easier to return to wakeful sleep. The earphone was pulling my hair, which was quite disturbing, but I didn't dare straighten it. I felt no tingling, only a pleasant heaviness. Now I wouldn't have felt swaying or unable to define exactly what position my body was in. But I was relaxed.","It was nice, kind of like when I go to sleep and I get these flashbacks of my day, like I'm reliving it. So I had a lot of these quite vivid memories, especially of yesterday, like when you think about your day in the evening, half asleep... I relaxed quite a bit and slowly managed to come out of that state by about the sixth count.","Nice, tingly, I couldn't tell you how long it lasted. It was quite a fluctuation in how relaxed I felt, but I didn't wait the time when it was going to end because it was nice to be in that state. There was this strange connection with one thing that suddenly came to me in a kind of realization. Like I was reflecting on my thoughts through this warm fog. Sometimes one would come, sometimes more clearly, sometimes less so, and there were times when it was just the warm fog, not the thoughts.",No,,Female,7,4,7,8,6,Attended a lecture about hypnosis;Read scientific literature about hypnosis;,,hun,8,confusion,confusion,embedded,relaxation,whitenoise,V10,No,Yes,,3573714,,2193312,5308051,,761167,,4845962,,1031372,4970669,,388327,,821417,,856634,8588,,4750774,,887346,,942849,5308000,4970618,4867834,5724387,760943,427288,6315717,5973010,,927081,,4845962,427338,,788680,3607261,4914310,4867885,8610,5973060,,409678,,5959311,,4856180,,776456,2021-05-14T15:43:48.287925,2021-05-14T15:54:22.872073,2021-05-14T16:14:38.840840,2021-05-14T16:36:48.160728,2021-05-14T16:57:48.784098,2021-05-14T17:16:14.009551,2021-05-14T17:21:56.716388,2021-05-14T15:36:43.884250,2021-05-14T15:36:46.366521,2021-05-14T15:54:22.872073,2021-05-14T16:14:38.840840,2021-05-14T16:36:48.160728,2021-05-14T16:57:48.784098,2021-05-14T15:56:05.650050,2021-05-14T16:16:27.055231,2021-05-14T16:38:36.375747,2021-05-14T16:59:31.567793,2021-05-14T16:02:08.912385,2021-05-14T16:22:02.691883,2021-05-14T16:44:07.297010,2021-05-14T17:05:08.949817,2021-05-14T16:09:05.304924,2021-05-14T16:28:59.086231,2021-05-14T16:51:03.694083,2021-05-14T17:12:05.336832,TRUE,sham,TRUE,sham,No,No,ZSMVL03,relaxation,confusion,5/14/2021 18:16:37,"YG, AL",2151414,5/14/2021,2:30:00 PM,5:40:00 PM,1,1,"Participants seated, Common sense eligibility check (those are not allowed to participate who are not at least 18 years old, who have participated in this study before, and who are clearly under the influence of recreational drugs or alcohol, and who had COVID-like symptoms), Participants are relaxed, not rushed, “Experiment in Progress” sign (or equivalent) to avoid disturbance","Turn phones to flight mode and put it away (not in their pockets), Loose any items which they are wearing and are tight and take off their accessories, No chewing gums in their mouths, Use toilet if they need to, Built a rapport about hypnosis, Explain about the EEG procedure, Answer participants' questions if any, Offer participants to use surgical mask if they are not comfortable with theirs","The experiment will take about one hour and half during which they will go through four different procedure, They should read each technique' instruction carefully, Adjust volume on headphone - if it felt uncomfortable during the experiment they can adjust its placement, They can call us at any time during the experiment if they need anything (e.g. need to use toilet), Ask them not to shake their head or turn it to left or right., They can eat during inter-procedures intervals, Put the warning chair in the entryway and turn the red warning light on., Start recording EEG before starting OS program, Tell participant to slow down the mouse click speed (it might cause skipping a page), Disable internet connection of the participants' computer",Nothing extraordinary happened,,"Turn off the amplifier first, then disconnect it from the cap, and then take the cap off the participants' heads., Debriefing: give participant a complete information about the study (which procedures were the real hypnosis and which ones were control), Ask how they feel and make sure they feel completely aware and awake (If they felt dizzy or had a headache, tell them it is a normal feeling and offer them water and snacks, Make sure the tub of gel is firmly closed., Disinfect the recording and control rooms with isopropyl alcohol, Close the curtain in the control room to prevent the EEG cap from being exposed to the sunlight., Check if there is personal information in free-text descriptions.

Emiatt egy szokványos, igen ellazult állapotba kerültem. Kevés gondolatom támadt közben, és az idő múlásával egyre kevesebb.","Az előző, fehér zajos néhány perc alatt sokkal jobban le tudtam nyugodni, relaxálni. Engem kizökkentett a sok beszéd, nem volt hihető számomra. Csak azt látom magam előtt, ahogy a terapeuta suttog a mikrofonba, és ez kizökkent minden egyes alkalommal, nem tudom beleélni magam. Tudom, elmondták, hogy valódi hipnózis hiányában ugyanúgy lehet róla szó a felvételen, mégis zavaró számomra. Ezek a megjegyzések, például \most mély hipnózisban van...\"" mindig egy kicsit vissza-vissza rántanak a valóságba.""","Az előzőhöz hasonlóan zavart a terapeuta beszéde, felfigyeltem az ismétlődésekre, apró hangokra amelyek a beszéd során keletkeznek, és a levegővétel hangjára. Ezek továbbra is zavartak az ellazulásban. Voltak azonban nagyon rövid részek amikor bele tudtam feledkezni. Emiatt legjobb tudomásom szerint az \elmélyült állapotban maradós\"" részben sem éreztem semmi rendhagyót az előzőekhez képest simán csak relaxáltam. Valamivel hosszabbnak éreztem ezt az utolsó fázist az előbbieknél valamivel mélyeb relaxációt sikerült elérnem (szerintem) mint például a másodiknál de ezt nem az eltérő módszernek tudom be hiszen igen zavaró volt csak annak hogy már az előzőek után alapból valamelyest \""mélyebbről indultam\"".""","Szerintem elrontottam ezt a fázist. Nem rémlik, hogy a hang megkért volna a szemem becsukására, de nem zárom ki a lehetőséget, hogy csak figyelmetlen voltam. Ugyanakkor nagyon precízen igyekeztem teljesíteni minden utasítást, és az előző 3 alkalommal mindnél végig csukva tartottam a szemem, ahogy a hang kérte. Mindennek ellenére az elmélyülés alatt nem kalandoztak el a gondolataim túlságosan, főleg az elején még az említett izmok és működésük járt a fejemben, és a figyelmem saját magamon összpontosult ezekre a helyekre. Legszívesebben visszahallgatnám a felvételt, hogy elhangzott-e a \csukja be a szemét\"" és ha igen akkor megismételném ezt a részt.""","I was a little bit afraid I'd fall asleep, because I practice [text deleted for blinding] from time to time, especially before I go to sleep. That put me in a habitual, very relaxed state. I had very few thoughts during this time, and fewer and fewer as time went on.","In the few minutes before, [text deleted for blinding] I was able to calm down, relax much more. I was thrown off by all the talking, it was not believable to me. All I can see is the therapist whispering into the microphone and it throws me off every time, I can't get into it. I know, I was told that in the absence of [text deleted for blinding] it might as well be on the recording, but it's still confusing to me. These comments, like [text deleted for blinding], always pull me back a little bit to reality.""","As before, I was disturbed by the therapist's speech, noticing the repetitions, the small sounds that occur during speech, and the sound of breathing. These continued to disturb my relaxation. There were, however, very brief moments when I could forget myself. Because of this, to the best of my knowledge, I didn't feel anything unusual in the [text deleted for blinding] part, compared to the previous ones, I just relaxed. It felt a bit longer in this [text deleted for blinding] phase because I managed to achieve a slightly deeper relaxation (I think) than in the second one, but I don't attribute this to the different method, because it was quite disturbing, but to the fact that I started from a somewhat deeper place after the previous ones.""","I think I messed up this phase. I don't recall the voice asking me to close my eyes, but I don't rule out the possibility that I was just inattentive. However, I have been very precise in following all the instructions, and I have kept my eyes closed all the previous 3 times [text deleted for blinding]. Nevertheless, during [text deleted for blinding] my mind did not wander too much, especially at the beginning I was still thinking about [text deleted for blinding] and my attention was focused on myself. I'd like to listen back to the recording to see if the words ""close your eyes"" were spoken and if so, repeat that part.""",Yes,"Az összes beszédes rész ahol relaxálnom kellett volna igen zavaró volt, kivéve a negyediket, ahol az izmokról mesélt a hang.

Őszintén, nem érzékeltem semmivel másabbat, mint amikor az éber állapotomat mérték fel pár perccel korábban. ","Számomra ez sokkal hipnotikusabbnak tűnt, mint az előző. Sokkal jobban el tudtam lazulni, sokkal jobban a gondolataimba tudtam merülni. Küzdenem kellett, hogy el ne aludjak, Olyan érzés volt, mikor reggel kinyomom az ébresztőt, és 5 perc szundi alatt ebbe az állapotba kerülök. Számomra kellemetlen volt. Túlságosan hossszúnak érzékeltem a hang utáni szünetet, mérgessé és türelmetlenné váltam.","Most is nagyon álmos lettem, nehéz volt tartanom a fejemet. Többször is kirázott a hideg, de szerintem ez csak a szoba hőmérséklete miatt volt. Enyhén elindultak a gondolataim. Most is vártam már a végét a szünetnek, annyira, hogy kénytelen voltam ki-kinyitogatni a szemem. Nem tudom, lehet én csináltam vmit rosszul, bocsánat. Most nem lazultam el, sőt a szék kényelmetlenségét a fenekemben sokkal jobban éreztem. A tudatom tényleg elfelejtett néhány dolgot, de ami feltűnt, hogy ugyan azt mondta el kétszer, arra emlékszem. Illetve a szünet utáni nyelvbotlást már harmadszorra sem javították ki.","Nem monsta az elején, hogy csukjam be a szemem, ezért a történetet nyitott szemmel hallgattam végig. Érzéseimszerintem egyáltalán nem kerültem hipnotikus állapotba. A  várakozás kb felénél, mikor már becsuktam a szememe, utána megint lassult a lélegzetem és alvás előtti állapotba kerültem. A visszatííírő számoláskor el tudtam volna aludni.","I became a bit calmer than usual. Honestly, I didn't sense anything different than I had when [text deleted for blinding] a few minutes earlier.","To me, it felt much more hypnotic than the previous one. I was able to relax much more, I was able to get much more immersed in my thoughts. I had to fight not to fall asleep, It was like when I snooze the alarm in the morning and within 5 minutes of snoozing I'd be in that state. It was uncomfortable for me. I perceived the [text deleted for blinding] far too long, I became angry and impatient.","I was very sleepy this time too, it was difficult to keep my head. I had several chills, but I think it was just the temperature in the room. My thoughts started to race slightly. Now I was looking forward to the [text deleted for blinding], so much that I had to open my eyes from time to time. I don't know, maybe I did something wrong, sorry. I didn't relax this time, in fact the discomfort of the chair in my butt was much more noticable. My mind really forgot some things, but what I did notice, [text deleted for blinding], I remember. Or rather, [text deleted for blinding] was not corrected.","He didn't tell me to close my eyes at the beginning, so I listened to the story with my eyes open. I did not feel hypnotized at all. About halfway through [text deleted for blinding], when I had closed my eyes, my breathing slowed down again and I went into a pre-sleep state. I could have fallen asleep during [text deleted for blinding].",No,"A második és főleg a harmadinkál fokozatosan növekvő frusztrációt éreztem. Ez nem tudom, hogy a kísérlet része volt, vagy a szobában lévő háttérzaj, a szék kényelmetlensége, a vezetékek miatti kényelmetlenség, a sapka súlya, vagy a fülhallgató  miatt kialakult fejfájásom, illetve az éhségem okozta, esetleg ezeknek az egyvelege.

Az elején különösen, de a végére elkezdett kicsit kényelmetlen lenni az ülés, és akkor már vártam, hogy vége legyen. *igazán voltak^Kicsit nyomja a fülemet ez a szerkezet, azt próbáltam megígazítani.","Most nem éreztem magam annyira ellazultan, mint az előbb. Igazából azt hittem valamiért, hogy most csak a white noise lesz, és már az egy kicsit zavaró volt, mert a fülesnek csak a bal oldala megy, ezért olyan, mintha el lenne romlana, azért zúgna, meg így eléggé behallatszanak a külső zajok. Amikor elkezdődött a csend, akkor elég hamar elkezdtem unni, és kez egy kicsit fájni a fejm, meg nyomját ezek az elektródák is. Most csak úgy éreztem, hogy ülök, és várok valamit. Nem értem, hogy a beszélő lélegzése miért van rajta a felvételen.","Most sem éreztem magam különösen sehogy, nehezen tudok már hogy ülni. msot is kicsit indokolatlannak éreztem, hogy itt ülök, és továbbra sem értem ,hogy miért van a férfi lélegzése a felvételen. Olyan, mintha egymás mellett ülnénk itt némán és várnánk egymástól valamit. Meg mostmár tudom, hogy ezt el kell majd mondanom, szóval mindenre, ami történik odafigyelek, hogy le tudjam majd írni. Most nehezebb volt csukva tartani a szemem, a végénmár alig tudtam megvárni a számolás végét is.","Ez most sokkal nyugisabb volt, mint az előző kettő, jól ellazított a szöveg, kicsit sajnáltam is amikor vége lett. Már eléggé elálmosodtam itt közben, ezalatt a csend alatt majdnem el is aludtam párszor szerintem. Aztán pózt akartam váltani, és kicsit belegabalyodtam a zsinórokba, amitől eléggé kizökkentem, és onnantól már csak vártam, hogy vége legyen. Nagyon nyomja már a fülem ez a fejhallagtó.","I was calm, I didn't really have thoughts, a bit like I imagine meditation should work, but it never does. Especially at the beginning, but towards the end I started to feel a bit uncomfortable in the session, and then I was waiting for it to end. I had a little pressure on my ears from this contraption, I tried to soften that.","This time I didn't feel as relaxed as before. I actually thought for some reason that it was just going to be [text deleted for blinding], and that was a bit distracting, because the earpiece only goes on the left side, so it's like it's broken, it's buzzing, and it's not really blocking external noise out. Once the silence started, I started to get bored quite quickly and I started to get a bit of a headache and also pressure from these electrodes. Now I just feel like I'm sitting and waiting for something. I don't understand [text deleted for blinding].","I also felt a bit unjustified sitting here, and I still don't understand why I have [text deleted for blinding]. It's as if we are sitting here silently waiting for something from each other. And I know now that I'm going to have to say this, so I'm paying attention to everything that's going on so I can write it down. Now it was harder to keep my eyes closed, I could hardly wait for the counting to end.","This one was much calmer than the previous two, the speech relaxed me, I was a little sad that it ended. I've been pretty sleepy during this, I think I almost fell asleep a couple of times during the silence. Then I wanted to change the pose, and got a bit tangled up in the cords, which threw me off, and from then on I just waited for it to end. I'm getting a lot of pressure on my ears with the headphones.",Yes,"Elég kényelmetlen egyhelyben ülni ennyi időn keresztül, meg eléggé nyomta a fejemet a műszer. Amikor asszem a negyedik dolognál fel kellett nézni a mennyezetre,az kényelmetlen volt, mert hátra kellett feszítenem a fejem, meg pont fölöttem volt egy lámpa, ami belevilágított a szemembe.

Nem érzékeltem abban a pozícióban a testemet amiben volt, sokkal inkább úgy éreztem hogy egy puha párnán pihenek, nagyon mély ellazultságot éreztem és nem akartam volna megmozdulni, mert olyan jó volt az az állapot. ","Elég fáradtnak és álmosnak éreztem magam. Bevallom, egy picit talán unatkoztam is. Valamint azon gondolkodtam, hogy vajon milyen tudatalatti szuggesztiókat kaphatok közben és hogy ez hogyan fog hatni rám. Póbáltam kizárni a mindennapi gondolataimat, de ez sajnos nem minden pillanatban sikerült.","A fehér zaj engem egy hatalmas vízesésre emlékeztetett. Több gondolat is eszembe jutott erről a hangról, az egyik a vízesés hatalmas ereje, ahogy lezúdul a sziklákról és utána gyönyörű hegyek jelentek meg a szemem előtt, egy vonattal haladtam át az egyik hegy magaslatán és ahogy lenéztem, lent volt egy gyönyörű tó és ott volt a vízesés. Ekkor már lent voltam közvezlenül a zuhatag mellett és szemléltem a csodás tájat. Az Alpokban volt és annyira természetes és elemi érzés volt, és vízesésről az erején kívül még a tisztasága volt az , ami megragadott. Nem akartam eljönni onnan, nagyon jó élmény volt. Úgy éreztem, hogy szabadon lélegezhetek.","Nagyon mélyen éreztem magam. Szinte teljesen ráfókuszáltam a hipnózis indukciót adó szavaira, így ebben az állapotban, mikor csönd volt, már alig voltak mindennapokkal kapcsolatos gondolataim. Inkább ilyen teljes ürességet éreztem, és várakozást arra, hogy megszólaljon és halljam a hangját újra. És mikor utána újból megszólalt, úgy éreztem, teljesen rá tudok fókuszálni, minden egyes hangjára külön. Szóval ezalatta  pár perc alatt, nagyon kellemesen és kényelmesen ellazulva, teljesen fókuszált állapotban éreztem magam, egy kellemes csöndben és ürességben, amit nem töltöttek meg mindenféle gondoaltok, csak a várakozás. ","It was like lying on a very, very comfortable pillow. I didn't feel my body in the position it was in, it felt more like I was resting on a soft cushion, I felt very deeply relaxed and I didn't want to move because it was so good.","I felt quite tired and sleepy. I admit, I was probably a little bored. I was also wondering what kind of subconscious suggestion I might be getting and how it would affect me. I tried to shut out my everyday thoughts, but unfortunately I didn't always succeed.","The [text deleted for blinding] reminded me of a huge waterfall. Several thoughts came to my mind about this sound, one was the sheer power of the waterfall as it cascaded down the cliffs and then I saw beautiful mountains, I was driving a train over the top of one of the mountains and as I looked down there was a beautiful lake below and there was the waterfall. At this point I was already down by the waterfall and looking at the beautiful scenery. It was in the Alps and it felt so natural and elemental, and the thing that struck me about the waterfall, apart from its power, was its purity. I didn't want to leave there, it was a great experience. I felt like I could breathe freely.","I felt that I was very deep. I was almost completely focused on the words of [text deleted for blinding], so in this state, when it was silent, I had hardly any thoughts about everyday life. Rather, I felt such a complete emptiness, and an awaiting for him to speak and for me to hear his voice again. And when he spoke again afterwards, I felt I could focus on him completely, every distint sound. So during those few minutes, I felt very pleasantly and comfortably relaxed, completely focused, in a pleasant silence and emptiness, not filled with any thoughts, just waiting.",No,,Female,6,1,8,9,7,Attended a lecture about hypnosis;Heard/read about it on the internet;,,hun,8,confusion,confusion,embedded,whitenoise,relaxation,V10,Yes,Yes,,2114021,,4451833,4904169,,709927,,3260773,,1010234,4573258,,331877,,797774,,834527,13667,,4442099,,869055,,912349,4904118,4573207,4464997,5320514,709722,376143,5920357,5577643,,892997,,4451833,376193,,755374,4465048,4516898,3301385,13667,5577693,,351533,,5566549,,4463464,,731493,2021-05-07T12:33:40.167198,2021-05-07T12:44:51.806957,2021-05-07T13:03:07.445636,2021-05-07T13:22:25.308720,2021-05-07T13:41:48.971337,2021-05-07T14:00:21.667546,2021-05-07T14:06:04.380791,2021-05-07T12:27:27.716231,2021-05-07T12:27:31.230994,2021-05-07T12:44:51.806957,2021-05-07T13:03:07.445636,2021-05-07T13:22:25.308720,2021-05-07T13:41:48.971337,2021-05-07T12:46:34.586673,2021-05-07T13:04:55.659715,2021-05-07T13:24:08.085518,2021-05-07T13:43:37.182506,2021-05-07T12:52:37.853193,2021-05-07T13:10:31.319690,2021-05-07T13:29:45.476975,2021-05-07T13:49:08.093478,2021-05-07T12:59:34.281696,2021-05-07T13:17:27.711995,2021-05-07T13:36:41.863573,2021-05-07T13:56:04.488053,TRUE,sham,sham,TRUE,No,No,C12h21o11,relaxation,confusion,5/7/2021 14:31:58,"KG, AL",215711,5/7/2021,11:00:00 AM,2:10:00 PM,1,1,"Participants seated, Common sense eligibility check (those are not allowed to participate who are not at least 18 years old, who have participated in this study before, and who are clearly under the influence of recreational drugs or alcohol, and who had COVID-like symptoms), Participants are relaxed, not rushed, “Experiment in Progress” sign (or equivalent) to avoid disturbance","Turn phones to flight mode and put it away (not in their pockets), Loose any items which they are wearing and are tight and take off their accessories, No chewing gums in their mouths, Use toilet if they need to, Built a rapport about hypnosis, Explain about the EEG procedure, Answer participants' questions if any, Offer participants to use surgical mask if they are not comfortable with theirs","The experiment will take about one hour and half during which they will go through four different procedure, They should read each technique' instruction carefully, Adjust volume on headphone - if it felt uncomfortable during the experiment they can adjust its placement, They can call us at any time during the experiment if they need anything (e.g. need to use toilet), Ask them not to shake their head or turn it to left or right., They can eat during inter-procedures intervals, Put the warning chair in the entryway and turn the red warning light on., Start recording EEG before starting OS program, Tell participant to slow down the mouse click speed (it might cause skipping a page), Disable internet connection of the participants' computer",Nothing extraordinary happened,,"First, in Recorder software, stop both the recording and monitoring., Turn off the amplifier first, then disconnect it from the cap, and then take the cap off the participants' heads., Debriefing: give participant a complete information about the study (which procedures were the real hypnosis and which ones were control), Ask how they feel and make sure they feel completely aware and awake (If they felt dizzy or had a headache, tell them it is a normal feeling and offer them water and snacks, Make sure the tub of gel is firmly closed., Disinfect the recording and control rooms with isopropyl alcohol, Close the curtain in the control room to prevent the EEG cap from being exposed to the sunlight., Check if there is personal information in free-text descriptions.

I used to meditate sometimes, it was similar to that.","It was a very good experience, similar to what I experienced in meditation.

Egyre jobban elálmosodtam, szerintem ha tovább benne maradtam volna ebben az állapotban, el is aludtam volna. Olyankor szoktam ennyire nyugodt lenni, amikor pl. strandon fekszem vagy vonaton alszom, amikor van valamilyen hasonló háttérzaj, mint itt az elején. Jó érzés volt.","Az elején nem éreztem magam annyira ellazultnak, mint az előzőnél. Kevésbé tudtam kizárni a gondolataimat, és azon gondolkodtam, mit fogok majd írni. Arra figyeltem, hogy ki kell mennem mosdóba. Aztán egy idő után kezdtem elálmosodni és éreztem, hogy elnehezül a fejem. Jó lett volna, ha kényelmesebb pl a szék, idegesített, hogy nem tudom letenni a fejem, vagy kinyújtani a lábamat. Ez elkezdett kicsit idegesíteni, és azt vártam, mikor lesz már vége. Álmosságot éreztem, de nyugodtságot nem annyira. ","Nem éreztem semmi különöset. Nyugodt voltam az elején, de aztán elkezdtem gondolkodni mindennapi dolgokon, és már el is felejtettem, hogy milyen is volt az instrukció. Már frusztrált, hogy ennyi ideje ülnöm kell és erre az érzésre figyeltem, vártam, hogy vége legyen, kicsit túl hosszúnak is tűnt ez az idő. Ki is nyílt a szemem egy pillanatra. Hamarabb vissza is tértem az éber tudatállapotba, mint kellett volna. Az instrukció sem volt különös hatással, furcsa volt. ","Semmi különöset nem éreztem. Olyan volt, mint mikor elalváshoz készülődök, már lehunytam a szemem, de még gondolkodom, stb és nem tudok olyan könnyen elaludni. Már fáradtnak éreztem magam így az utolsó gyakorlatra. Különös álmosságot vagy nyugodtságot sem éreztem.","I felt very relaxed and calm. I was getting sleepier and sleepier, I think if I had stayed in that state longer I would have fallen asleep. I tend to be so calm when I'm lying on the beach or sleeping on a train, when there's a similar background noise to the one at the beginning. It felt good.","I didn't feel as relaxed at the beginning as I did with the previous one. I was less able to shut my thoughts out and think about what I was going to write. I focused on the fact that I had to go to the bathroom. Then, after a while, I started to feel sleepy and felt my head getting heavy. It would have been nice to have a more comfortable chair, for example, it was annoying not being able to put my head down or stretch my legs. It started to get a bit annoying and I was waiting for it to end. I felt sleepy, but not so much relaxed.","I didn't feel anything special. I was calm at first, but then I started thinking about everyday things and I forgot what the instructions were. I was getting frustrated at having to sit for so long and I was listening to that feeling, waiting for it to be over, it seemed a bit too long. My eyes opened for a moment. I was back in a waking state of consciousness sooner than I should have been. The instruction had no particular effect, it was strange.","I didn't feel anything special. It was like when I'm getting ready to go to sleep, I've closed my eyes, but I'm still thinking, etc. and I can't fall asleep easily. I was feeling tired by the last exercise. I didn't feel particularly sleepy or relaxed.",No,,Female,10,5,1,0,3,Attended a lecture about hypnosis;Heard/read about it on the internet;,,hun,9,whitenoise,whitenoise,relaxation,confusion,embedded,V10,No,No,,3013809,,4123707,4661104,,667942,,1967742,,934592,4325468,,292686,,763152,,791224,4172,,4098179,,824465,,872831,4661053,4325417,4217204,5077450,667785,334198,5529462,5186756,,844015,,4123707,334248,,709455,4217255,4269108,1981348,4173,5186805,,318412,,5178585,,4134551,,680830,2021-05-18T12:20:49.406092,2021-05-18T12:31:14.254907,2021-05-18T12:48:16.455597,2021-05-18T13:05:42.167939,2021-05-18T13:25:32.361707,2021-05-18T13:41:41.963133,2021-05-18T13:47:24.670178,2021-05-18T12:15:16.594699,2021-05-18T12:15:16.855700,2021-05-18T12:31:14.254907,2021-05-18T12:48:16.455597,2021-05-18T13:05:42.167939,2021-05-18T13:25:32.361707,2021-05-18T12:32:57.029785,2021-05-18T12:49:59.233682,2021-05-18T13:07:30.378245,2021-05-18T13:27:20.575103,2021-05-18T12:38:34.422311,2021-05-18T12:55:30.154967,2021-05-18T13:13:33.685711,2021-05-18T13:32:56.210432,2021-05-18T12:45:30.819870,2021-05-18T13:02:26.551389,2021-05-18T13:20:30.081722,2021-05-18T13:39:52.607764,sham,TRUE,TRUE,sham,No,No,KJEA27,confusion,relaxation,5/18/2021 18:05:24,V.V.

Ez történt meg többször, esésérzések után újra tudtam gondolkozni aztán megint azon kaptam magam, hogy ez félbemaradt valahol valamikor.","Elkalandoztak megint a gondolataim elképzelt szituációkat lejátszva, de mindig tudtam követni, hogy a helyszínek, szereplők, szituációk hogyan kapcsolódnak a valósághoz, vajon most miért gondolkozom ezeken. Illetve sokszor egy gondolatmenet átcsordult egy másikba, de ezt észre tudtam venni, illetve logikai kapcsolatot is fel tudtam fedezni köztük. Voltak aktívabban gondolkozós és elszenderülős pillanataim váltakozva, de nem tapasztaltam egyszer sem esésérzést, hanem mindig kevésbé hirtelen és fokozatos visszakerülést követtem vissza a kósza gondolatokhoz.","Nem különösebben éreztem semmit, annyi különös volt, hogy nem indultak el a gondolataim, nagyrészt csak relaxált voltam és észrevettem, hogy nem gondolkozom semmin és nem is érzem úgy hogy le kéne foglalni az elmém miközben nem folytak a gondolataim.","Nagyon elmélyültem, nem vagyok biztos benne, hogy elaludtam-e. Amikor megint éber voltam tudtam, hogy sok minden átszáguldott a gondolataim között, de nem tudnám felidézni mik voltak azok.","My thoughts were wandering, every now and then I'd start to play out an imaginary situation in my head, and then it would be interrupted and I was picking my head up often, like when someone is about to fall asleep and then returning to wakefulness after a falling feeling. This happened several times, after the feeling of falling I could think again and then again I would find myself thinking that it had interrupted somewhere and sometime.","My mind wandered again, playing out imagined situations, but I could always follow how the locations, characters, and situations were connected to reality, why I was thinking about them now. Or, many times one train of thought would spill over into another, but I could notice this and make logical connections between them. I have had alternating moments of more active thinking and dozing off, but never once have I experienced a feeling of falling, but always a less sudden and gradual return to the wandering thoughts.","I didn't feel anything in particular, it was strange that my thoughts didn't run off, I was mostly just relaxed and I noticed that I wasn't thinking about anything and I didn't feel like I needed to occupy my mind while my thoughts weren't flowing.","I was very deep in thought, I'm not sure if I fell asleep.

Mivel a terapeuta légzését hallottam, nem igazán tudtam ellazulni teljesen (zavaró volt, hogy a fülembe liheg).A végén olyan érzésem volt, mintha már hosszú ideje nem aludtam volna, és kicsit el is kezdtem fázni, legalábbis a hátamon hűvösebb érzés fogott el. Ha hosszú ideje ébren vagyok, van, hogy ilyen érzés fog el.","Ugyanazt, mint az előzőben, zavart a terapeuta lihegése, de ellazultam.

As I could hear the therapist's breathing, I couldn't really relax completely (it was distracting to have him breathing in my ear). At the end, I felt like I hadn't slept for a long time and I started to feel a bit cold, or at least I had a cooler feeling on my back. When I've been awake for a long time, I sometimes get that feeling.","Same as before, distracted by the therapist's panting, but was relaxed. I wasn't hypnotized, but I actually had to realize that I had no idea what state I would have to be in exactly to be able to say here that I was ""hypnotized.""","I'm not sure (now), but I don't remember having to close my eyes.
